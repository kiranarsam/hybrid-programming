# Gamma Categorization

- Design patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of Gang of Four authors

## Creational Patterns:
- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs. Implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

## Structural Patterns:
- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
- Many Patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
- Stress the importance of Good API

## Behavioral Patterns:
- They are all different; no central theme
