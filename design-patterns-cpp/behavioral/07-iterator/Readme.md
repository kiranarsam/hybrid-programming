## Iterator
- How traversal of data structures happens and who makes it happen.

## Motivation
- Iteration (traversal) is a core functionality of various data structures

- An iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
    - Keeps a reference to the current element
    - Knows how to move to a different element

- Can be used implicitly
    - Range-based for
    - Coroutines

## Iterator
- An object that facilitates the traversal of a data structure.

## Summary
- An object can be iterated (traversed) if it defines a begin()/end() pair

- An iterator specified how you can traverse an object

- Typically requires of != and ++ operators

- ++ is called sporadically, so cannot be recursive, but...

- Coroutines allow recursion through generator-yielding functions
